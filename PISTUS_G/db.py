    # We open a transaction.
    # A transaction is a sequence of read/write statements that 
    # have a permanent result in the database only if they all succeed.
    #
    # More concretely, in this function we create many tables in the database.
    # The transaction is therefore a sequence of CREATE TABLE statements such as :
    #
    # BEGIN
    # CREATE TABLE XXX
    # CREATE TABLE YYY
    # CREATE TABLE ZZZ
    # ....
    #
    # If no error occurs, all the tables are permanently created in the database.
    # If an error occurs while creating a table (for instance YYY), no table will be created, even those for which 
    # the statement CREATE TABLE has already been executed (in this example, XXX).
    #
    # When we start a transaction with the statement BEGIN, we must end it with either COMMIT
    # or ROLLBACK.
    # 
    # * COMMIT is called when no error occurs. After calling COMMIT, the result of all the statements in 
    # the transaction is permanetly written to the database. In our example, COMMIT results in actually creating all the tables
    # (XXX, YYY, ZZZ, ....)
    #
    # * ROLLBACK is called when any error occurs in the transaction. Calling ROLLBACK means that 
    # the database is not modified (in our example, no table is created).
