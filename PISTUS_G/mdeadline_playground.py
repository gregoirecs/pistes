"""This file shows an example of how we implement a background task that is executed periodically.
It also shows how we send an email in Python.

#####################################################################

IMPORTANT: before you run this file, open a new terminal window and type the following command:

python -m smtpd -c DebuggingServer -n localhost:1025

This will start a simple SMTP server on your machine listening on port 1025

#####################################################################

When you execute this file as a Python script, the instructions in the main section of the file 
are run (see bottom of the file).
These instructions:

* Create a window and add a label to it.
* Start a background process (implemented in the function send_email) that connects to a SMTP server and 
sends an email.
* The background process is repeated every 5 seconds.

####################################################################################################
MAKE SURE YOU READ THE CODE AND THE COMMENTS TO LEARN HOW THESE OPERATIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED
